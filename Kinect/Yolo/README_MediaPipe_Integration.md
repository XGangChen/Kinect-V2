# MediaPipe Gesture Recognition Integration

## Overview
I've successfully integrated MediaPipe hand tracking and gesture recognition into your existing YOLO pose estimation code. The system now performs:

1. **YOLO Pose Detection**: Body keypoint detection and skeleton drawing with depth information
2. **MediaPipe Hand Tracking**: Hand landmark detection and tracking
3. **Gesture Recognition**: Real-time gesture classification based on finger positions
4. **Depth Integration**: Both pose and gesture data include depth information from Kinect

## Key Features Added

### 1. Gesture Recognition
The system can recognize the following gestures:
- **Fist**: All fingers closed
- **Pointing**: Only index finger extended
- **Peace/Victory**: Index and middle fingers extended
- **Three**: Index, middle, and ring fingers extended
- **Four**: All fingers except thumb extended
- **Open Hand**: All five fingers extended
- **Thumbs Up**: Only thumb extended

### 2. Multi-hand Support
- Detects up to 2 hands simultaneously
- Each hand gets separate gesture recognition
- Displays depth information for each detected hand

### 3. Visual Feedback
- Hand landmarks are drawn with connections
- Gesture names are displayed with depth information
- Different colors for different body parts in pose estimation

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
- `mediapipe`: For hand tracking and landmark detection
- Integration with existing OpenCV, YOLO, and Kinect libraries

### Core Functions
1. `recognize_gesture(hand_landmarks)`: Analyzes finger positions to classify gestures
2. `draw_hand_landmarks_and_gestures(img, results, depth_frame)`: Renders hand landmarks and gesture labels
3. Enhanced main loop with MediaPipe processing

### Configuration
- `max_num_hands=2`: Maximum number of hands to detect
- `min_detection_confidence=0.7`: Minimum confidence for hand detection
- `min_tracking_confidence=0.5`: Minimum confidence for hand tracking

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Enhanced System
```bash
conda activate kinectx
python yolo11_skeleton.py
```

### Testing MediaPipe Installation
```bash
conda activate kinectx
python test_mediapipe.py
```

### Controls
- Press 'q' to quit the application
- The system displays multiple windows:
  - **color**: Main RGB feed with pose and gesture overlays
  - **depth**: Depth visualization
  - Optional: bigdepth, color_depth_map windows

## Performance Considerations

1. **GPU Acceleration**: YOLO runs on GPU if available, MediaPipe runs on CPU
2. **Real-time Processing**: Both systems run in parallel for each frame
3. **Confidence Thresholds**: Adjustable thresholds for both pose and gesture detection

## Customization Options

### Gesture Recognition
You can easily add new gestures by modifying the `recognize_gesture()` function:
```python
# Example: Add "OK" gesture (thumb and index forming circle)
if thumb_extended and index_extended and not other_fingers:
    return "OK Sign"
```

### Visual Appearance
Modify colors, text size, and drawing styles in the drawing functions.

### Detection Sensitivity
Adjust confidence thresholds in the MediaPipe hands configuration.

## Integration Benefits

1. **Comprehensive Human Analysis**: Both body pose and hand gestures
2. **Depth-aware Recognition**: 3D spatial information for all detections
3. **Real-time Performance**: Optimized for live video processing
4. **Modular Design**: Easy to extend with additional recognition features

The system now provides a complete solution for human motion and gesture analysis with depth information, suitable for applications like:
- Human-computer interaction
- Gesture-based control systems
- Motion analysis and biomechanics
- Assistive technologies
- Gaming and entertainment applications
